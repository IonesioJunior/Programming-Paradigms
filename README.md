# Programming Paradigms 

  Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features. Some paradigms are concerned mainly with implications for the execution model of the language, such as allowing side effects, or whether the sequence of operations is defined by the execution model. Other paradigms are concerned mainly with the way that code is organized, such as grouping code into units along with the state that is modified by the code. Yet others are concerned mainly with the style of syntax and grammar.In this repository have some exercise codes in different languages, using different paradigms.

### Implementations

  In this repository you will find the following paradigms:

```
-  Imperative Paradigm (using C)
-  Logic Paradigm (using Prolog)
-  Functional Paradigm (using Haskell)
-  Concurrent Paradigm

```

## Projects
  You still will find some projects code using different paradigms/languages for the same problem.
